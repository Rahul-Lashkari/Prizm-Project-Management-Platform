# Prizm-Project-Management-Platform
 At age 15, built an entire MVP for Prizm—a B2B SaaS Project Management Platform—from scratch. Delivered a complete startup-level MVP, including everything from A to Z: responsive website, mobile screens, dashboards, research exploration, visual branding, UI/UX concepts, workflows, wireframes, prototypes, interactions, and full project documentation.
