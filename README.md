# **Prizm - Project Management Platform**

### **Description**  
At the age of 15, I built an entire MVP for **Prizm**â€”a B2B SaaS Project Management Platformâ€”from scratch. This startup-level MVP includes everything from A to Z:  
- A responsive landing page
- Mobile screens and dashboards  
- Research exploration  
- Visual branding  
- UI/UX concepts, DevEx/DevRel, workflows, wireframes, prototypes, and interactions  
- Complete project documentation

## **01. Project Overview**  
I began by defining the core concept of Prizm, starting with:  
- A detailed project brief  
- Logo design and branding  
- How Prizm works?  
- Key challenges and risks identification  
- Mapping the roadmap to deliver a scalable platform  

Prizm was born from this foundational vision!

## **02. Visual Exploration**  
Crafting the visual identity was a key step:  
- Started with an **Inspiration Board** to shape the design direction.  
- Developed **moodboards**, **logo concepts**, **color palettes**, **typography**, and **style guides**.  
- Brought creativity to life while keeping user accessibility in mind.

## **03. Research Exploration**  
Research was at the heart of this project. I conducted:  
- **Persona & Empathy Mapping** to empathize with end-users.  
- **User Interviews** to uncover pain points and goals.  
- **User Journey Mapping** to refine the workflow and deliver optimal solutions.  

These insights directly influenced the platformâ€™s design.

## **04. Final Designs**  
This is where it all came together! The final designs include:  
- Sketches to **low-fidelity wireframes** for quick iteration.  
- High-fidelity wireframes and fully responsive mobile screens.  
- Polished components for consistent UI/UX design.
